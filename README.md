Comes with Jasmine test suites (created by me:) )

## Description and instructions
RSS feed reader allows to read RSS feeds.

To run the app you can either download or clone the repository:

1. Press the green 'Clone or download' button in the right corner

2. Press 'Download ZIP' or copy the link and go ahead with git clone

3. Navigate into the folder and open index.html file

4. Make sure all tests are passed (hint: green text on the bottom of the page should appear a couple of second after the app has loaded)

5. (Optional) You may want to disable the tests.

To do so, open index.html file in your code editor, remove all jasmine-related scripts and links
